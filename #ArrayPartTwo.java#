				because you are backtracking, you need to see where you've been before and then "backtrack", or reset back to that point if you've failed to complete the game. At least I used backtracking, I'm sure there's a more nuanced way to do this but I just went with what I knew.

																																	    Can someone explain why we need isSolvable(m, arr, i - 1) in the return statement? Can it be just

																																	    return isSolvble(m, arr, i+1) || isSolvble(m, arr, i+m)?

																																	    Consider the following situation:

																																	    arr = { 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 }; m = 4

																																					     You start off in position 0:

		{ 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 }

		You can't walk forward, but you can jump forward by m positions: i + m = 0 + 4 = 4, now you're at position 4:

		    { 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 }

		So far, so good.

		    Now, once again, you can't walk forward, but this time you can't jump forward either because i + m = 4 + 4 = 8; position 8 contains a 1, not a legal move, but since you're allowed to walk backward to i - 1 = 3 which contains a 0, it's a legal move so you end up in position 3:

		{ 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 }

		Now you can jump from here because i + m = 3 + 4 = 7; position 7 contains a 0, legal move, you end up here:

		{ 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 }

            Then from here you can jump 4 position forward and end up at i = 11 which is beyond the array length and you win!

            This is just one example of how walking backward would be a useful move.

            Hope that helped!

                I used the same logic. But the test cases are getting timed out. One of them involves testing 5000 diffeent cases and I ran one "FOR" loop with i=0 to 4999 having to initialize a new array 1D for every case. I don't know whether is there any algorithm to beat that case. Taking more time to get executed.

                arr={0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 } ,m=4

                Step 1: It jumps to i=i+m

                arr={1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 }

                Step 2: From here, it can either go i+1 or i-1. But if it goes to i+1, it can't return back and will term as false. Only if it goes to i-1 will there be a win.

																		   So, how is it prioritised of whether to go ahead or back?

																		   The modified array if it goes i+1:

		    arr={1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 }

		    Would this not be an issue that once we mark it visited and then we try to retrace back, with isSolvable(m, arr, i - 1), as if i-1 is visited, it will be marked as 1, changing the base array.

            I think it's because of the order, of checking index.
            I did as below as it was ok.

                if (i < 0) return fince the back step did not seem useful. It is only when you have a hole in the array where you can jump only by shifting left that the problem becomes really interesting.

            Hi. The question states "It is guaranteed that the value of game[0] is always 0", so your test case is not valid.

                            Your code fails on the following test case:

                            1
                            18 4

                                            Now your code h, use a stack. Pop the elements out of the stack only after verifying game[i+1],game[i-1] and game[i+leap] has a 0 or not.

            The problem is that you greedily always go forward as much as possible if you can and this is incorrect. Just because you can leap doesn't mean you should. Lets take the following scenarn.

		    To fix your code, you need to do two things: 1) you need to have a way to try and go forward (and leap from there) and 2) you need to have a way to try and go backwards (and leap from there).

}else if(i+1<game.length&&game[i+1]==0){
     i=i+1;

 }else if(i+1<game.length&&game[i+1]==1){
     return false;

     return false;

            Is it failing? Or is it timing out? It's important to know which one ismbol and method anWin cannot applied to the given type.....? what is the problem i have no idea

            Itis depth-first-search. Our recursive calls in the solution are DFS. I recommend reading more about depth-first-search on Google.

        can you do it without changing the method signature? static boolean canWin(int[] game,int leap)
    return false;
        }

            hank you so much for this. I was into this issue and tired to tinker aro und to check if its https://kodi.software/download/ possible but couldnt get it done. Now  = game.length;

            Stack<Integer> potentialIndexes = new Stack<>();
            potentialIndexes.push(0);

            while (!potentialIndexes.isEmpty()) {
                int i = potentialIndexes.pop();

                if (i >= n) return true;

                if (i < 0 || game[i] == 1) continue;

                game[i] = 1;

                potentialIndexes.push(i+1);
                potentialIndexes.push(i-1);BFS            0|
